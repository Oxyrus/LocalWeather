# LocalWeather (WIP)
This application displays the current weather based on your Geolocation (which may be, or may not, be accurate).

## Running

You must get an API key on OpenWeather and add it to your [constants](src/constants/index.js)

1. `$ git clone https://github.com/Oxyrus/LocalWeather.git`
2. `$ cd LocalWeather`
3. `$ npm i`
4. `$ npm start`

Visit [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) to see it in action.
